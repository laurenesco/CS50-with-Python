#   Instructions    #
#####################

# Fuel gauges indicate, often with fractions, just how much fuel is in a tank.
# For instance 1/4 indicates that a tank is 25% full,
# 1/2 indicates that a tank is 50% full, and 3/4 indicates that a tank is 75% full.
#
# In a file called fuel.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a fraction,
# formatted as X/Y, wherein each of X and Y is an integer, and then outputs,
# as a percentage rounded to the nearest integer, how much fuel is in the tank.
# If, though, 1% or less remains, output E instead to indicate that the tank is
# essentially empty. And if 99% or more remains, output F instead to indicate that
# the tank is essentially full.
#
# If, though, X or Y is not an integer, X is greater than Y, or Y is 0,
# instead prompt the user again. (It is not necessary for Y to be 4.)
# Be sure to catch any exceptions like ValueError or ZeroDivisionError.

#   How to Test    #
####################

# Hereâ€™s how to test your code manually:
#
#     Run your program with python fuel.py. Type 3/4 and press Enter. Your program should output:
#
#     75%
#
#     Run your program with python fuel.py. Type 1/4 and press Enter. Your program should output:
#
#     25%
#
#     Run your program with python fuel.py. Type 4/4 and press Enter. Your program should output:
#
#     F
#
#     Run your program with python fuel.py. Type 0/4 and press Enter. Your program should output:
#
#     E
#
#     Run your program with python fuel.py. Type 4/0 and press Enter. Your program should handle a ZeroDivisionError and prompt the user again.
#     Run your program with python fuel.py. Type three/four and press Enter. Your program should handle a ValueError and prompt the user again.
#     Run your program with python fuel.py. Type 1.5/3 and press Enter. Your program should handle a ValueError and prompt the user again.
#     Run your program with python fuel.py. Type 5/4 and press Enter. Your program should prompt the user again.
